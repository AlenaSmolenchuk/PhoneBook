# PhoneBook
a program that will solve this problem once and forever: create a phonebook where you can easily, quickly and efficiently find necessary information. Names and numbers, here we come.


Stage 1/4: A needle in the hay

In this stage, you should implement the simplest possible search to find the numbers of a few people whose names are listed in the file find.txt. The data is randomly sorted, so we should use a Linear Search to look through each of the directory entries until we find our target. While there may be faster ways to do this, avoid using optimizations like Maps in this stage - we'll get to optimizing in later stages.

Your program should output a message to show it has started searching, followed by a message stating how many entries out of the total number of targets in find.txt you were able to find along with the time taken to search for those entries
